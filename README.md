### TeamCity vSphere cloud plugin
#### Enables TeamCity integration with VMware vSphere cloud and allows users to automatically create/start/stop/delete virtual machines.

Before you can start using integration, you need to create a Virtual Machine instance.
TeamCity Build Agent must be installed and set to start automatically.

##### Build instructions
The plugin is bundled since TeamCity 10.0. The recent version is described in the [online TeamCity documentation](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Setting+Up+TeamCity+for+VMware+vSphere+and+vCenter).

Currently, the plugin is not buildable standalone. If you'd like to customize your plugin, please use the 9.0.x branch.
It's the branch the builds on teamcity.jetbrains.com are run against.
